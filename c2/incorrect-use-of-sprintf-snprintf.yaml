    message: >-
      C standards specify that the results are undefined if a call to
      sprintf(), snprintf(), vsprintf(), or vsnprintf() would cause copying
      to take place between objects that overlap (e.g., if the target
      string array and one of the supplied input arguments refer to the
      same buffer).
