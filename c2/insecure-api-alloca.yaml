    message: >-
      Use of alloca() is unsafe because it cannot ensure that the pointer 
      returned points to a valid and usable block of memory. The allocation 
      made may exceed the bounds of the stack, or even go further into other 
      objects in memory, and alloca() cannot determine such an error.
